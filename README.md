# <div align="center"> Android Developer level test </div>
## **Introduction**

Our Android team here at Agile Content just received a requirement to develop an app to 
discover the world of the  Pokémons.

All the information related to Pokémons  is provided by the  PokéApi, available at:

[https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/) 

In this API you will find how to get the full list of all the existing pokémons: 

[https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)

*Psst! You can use the limit and offset query params in order to paginate the results.*


 
Furthermore, the server returns the details of each Pokémon by adding the name or the id to 
the previous API: 

[https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu/](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu/)

[https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/25/](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/25/)
 
Write an Android application to browse and check the details of Pokémons.

To have a nice app, it would be great to show at least 150 pokémons in a list with the basic 
information (name and id).  

Then the user can click in each pokémon to get more information about it (choose several fields 
to show and a picture at least).



## **Specifications**

- Use Kotlin
- Choose a good architecture
- Retrieve all data from the provided API
- Use as many third party libraries as you want
- At least would be good to quickly browse the Pokémons and be able to see the details of each one at some detail screen

## **Bonus**
- Be Creative :)
- Error handling
- Implement tests
- Paginate results
- Response caching
- Possibility to filter the list by name
- Provide sweet layouts


This test is aimed at knowing how you  code an app, the technical decisions you  take along the process  and the overall cleanliness of your code. We do not require the app to be complete, but  it is always a bonus. 

*Happy coding!*
